  # ILI9341 HLA using SPIEx 
  
## Getting started

This prototype HLA is setup to use my extended version of the SPI analyzer
which allows me to capture the state of the DC pin during the captures.

This allows the sketch to have a list of the commands of the ILI9341

The SPIEx code is currently in my fork/branch of the SPI Analyzer.

Currently the code is just a test.  Not sure if it will be published or not.
